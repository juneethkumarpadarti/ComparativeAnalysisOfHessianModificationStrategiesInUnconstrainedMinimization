### Data Characteristics:

- **Dimensionality:** Functions include 2D, 3D, 4D, and n-dimensional cases to test scalability.
- **Complexity:** Includes simple convex, ill-conditioned, multi-modal, and highly nonlinear problems.
- **Purpose:** To evaluate how each Hessian modification strategy adapts to varying landscape difficulty and dimensionality.

All functions are mathematically defined within the source code rather than stored as static datasets, ensuring flexibility for parameter changes and reproducibility.
