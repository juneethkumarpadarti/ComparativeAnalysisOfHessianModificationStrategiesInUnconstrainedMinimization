# ComparativeAnalysisOfHessianModificationStrategiesInUnconstrainedMinimization
This project presents a comprehensive comparison of three Hessian modification strategies applied to a diverse set of 11 benchmark optimization problems. The objective was to evaluate the efficiency of each strategy in ensuring the Hessian matrix becomes positive definite, enabling convergence to the global minimum.
